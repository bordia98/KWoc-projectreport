<h2> Choosing the project</h2>

<p> Choosing a project in KWOC is one of the difficult task as there are a lot of choices available and you have to search them and understand to what extend you can contribute to it. As when I started KWOC I had started working on Django framework so for me the best thing was to search for a Django project to which I can contribute. So I choosed the project ACAD-Search which was under this domain selected an issue of it and started working on it.</p>
