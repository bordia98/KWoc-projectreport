<h2> Choosing the project</h2>

<p> Choosing a project in KWOC was one of the difficult task as there were a lot of choices available and you have to search them and understand to what extend you can contribute to it. As when I had started KWOC I was a beginner in web development in Django framework so for me the best thing was to search for a Django project to which I can contribute. So I choosed the project ACAD-Search which was under this domain selected an issue of it and started working on it.</p>

<h2>Progress in the project and solving the issue</h2>

So I choosed the project ACAD-search and the issue which i had selected was to customise the Django Administration page. The project was mentored by Vipul Ujawane who had created the issue. So accordingly I started working on it and finally pushed my code what i had done to the repositoy.
While doing the code I had come across many thing which were new to me and it definitely helped me to understand more about the concept which i was learning.
